# UrlFriendly

This code is a near exact copy of content taken from [Johan Bostr√∂m's blog](https://www.johanbostrom.se/blog/how-to-create-a-url-and-seo-friendly-string-in-csharp-text-to-slug-generator/) where he puts together a nice and efficient process for removing spaces, diacritics and other cultural characters from text. This makes it easier to use for things like URLs and identifiers.   

This code is packaged and put on NuGet for our own benefit but is, of course, welcome for everyone to use and share. Many thanks for Johan for putting this out.
